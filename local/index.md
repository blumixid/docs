{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_local_notm}} sits on a virtualized infrastructure that is behind your Enterprise firewall, providing the highest performing and most secure cloud infrastructure to you. {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} installs, remotely monitors, and manages {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_local_notm}} in your data center through {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}'s [Relay](#localrelay) technology. The logical architecture in [Figure 1](#figure01) describes how {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} is set up in your local environment and how {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} maintains your local instance:

![{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_local_notm}} architecture.](images/bmlocal_arch.png "Bluemix Local architecture diagram") 

Figure 1. {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_local_notm}} architecture
{: #figure01}

The inception virtual machine (inception VM) runs on your enterprise virtualized infrastructure behind your enterprise firewall. The inception VM creates an outbound network connection to the {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Operations center through the {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} relay technology. Relay performs several functions and is described in following [Relay](#localrelay) section.

The {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform components and core features that support the platform components run in a private, isolated virtual local area network (VLAN). {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_local_notm}} uses a VLAN for the private subnet. Using a private subnet rather than a public VLAN is more secure and can help avoid routing issues. The set of core features that make up and support the platform include the following:
<dl>
<dt>**Monitoring and logging**</dt>
<dd>The monitoring and logging features are deployed in your data centers through Relay, and the data remains in your data center. Alerts are sent back to IBM operations based on the defined alert criteria. No sensitive information is included in the alerts that are sent back to IBM.</dd>
<dt>**Network**</dt>
<dd>Relay is the delivery network included with {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local. Relay enables IBM to automatically and consistently deliver the latest updates to all local deployments, so that you always have an up-to-date and secure system. The traffic on this tunnel is automated activity for serving and maintaining the platform, compute resources, and services for your instance. The traffic includes the monitoring capability that is used by IBM operations to complete problem determination for your local instance. For more information about Relay, see [Relay](index.html#localrelay).</dd>
<dt>**Compute**</dt>
<dd>{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local uses app-centric runtime environments based on Cloud Foundry.</dd>
<dt>Local services</dt>
<dd>A set of services are available to be used privately in your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_local_notm}} environment. Typically, you decide which services you want for your environment prior to the deployment by the {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} team. For a list of available services, go to [Local services and runtimes](#table01).
</dd>
<dt>**Security intelligence**</dt>
<dd><p>{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} uses QRadar Security Intelligence Platform to provide a unified architecture for integrating several key components. These components include security information and event management, log management, anomaly detection, incident forensics, and configuration and vulnerability management. {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} also uses {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} QRadar security information and event management (SIEM) to monitor privileged user actions and successful and unsuccessful login attempts of application developers. QRadar reports provide the customer with visibility on by using the Reports and Logs section on the Administration page. For information about security reports, see [Viewing reports](/docs/admin/index.html#oc_report).</p>
<p>{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} BigFix ensures that fixes for operating systems are applied at appropriate frequencies. The patching process is automated, and the schedule is agreed upon between you and IBM. For information about maintenance and upgrades, see [Maintaining your local instance](index.html#maintainlocal).</p>
</dd>
</dl>

Your apps are deployed inside virtual containers that run on Cloud Foundry virtual machines. All Cloud Foundry components, such as cloud controllers, health managers, routers, and droplet execution agents (DEAs) are deployed when {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} is set up. The various {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} management components are also included in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} deployment.

DataPower appliances provide access to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} application domains. These appliances connect to the network that is accessible  from your intranet. Your users who are deploying apps and services get access from the network that is accessible from your intranet. You must provide seven IP addresses that have outbound internet access. DataPower appliances route from these customer IP addresses to the isolated {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} deployment. For information about the network specifications and infrastructure requirements, see [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local infrastructure requirements](/docs/local/index.html#localinfra).

### Relay
{: #localrelay}

Relay is the secure link between you enterprise network and {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Cloud Operations. The traffic over the relay connection is automated activity for serving and maintaining the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_local_notm}} platform, compute resources, and services for your instances. The traffic over the relay connection can be categorized as follows:

* monitoring and events
* security intelligence
* deployments and updates
* problem determination and fixes
* emergency maintenance

<dl>
<dt>
Monitoring and events
</dt>
<dd>
The monitoring and event features are deployed in your data center. Application data remains in your data center.<br>
The traffic over the relay connection includes the monitoring capability that is used by {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Operations to perform health monitoring and to complete problem determination when required.<br>
<p>No sensitive data is included in the monitoring information, meaning no passwords, no application data, no application logs, and no keys. The traffic over the relay includes flows from the inception VM to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Operations center.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
Security Intelligence
</dt>
<dd>
{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} uses QRadar Security Intelligence Platform to provide a unified architecture for integrating several key components. These components include security information and event management, log management, anomaly detection, incident forensics, and configuration and vulnerability management.<br>
<p>{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} also uses {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} QRadar security information and event management (SIEM) to monitor privileged user actions and successful and unsuccessful login attempts.</p>
<p>QRadar reports provide the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} administrator with visibility on events and event data by using the Reports and Logs section of the Administration page. QRadar reports are generated on a regular basis, either daily or monthly depending on the report type. All reports are retained for 90 days in the administration console for your retrieval. After that 90 days, the reports are available offline per request from {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} for 9 months. In total, reports are available for retrieval for up to 1 year.</p>
<p>No application data is included in the traffic consumed by QRadar. The only data that could potentially be considered as sensitive are user IDs for the login attempts reports and IP addresses of some {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} components.
The traffic over the relay includes the flows between the QRadar Event Processor in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_local_notm}} and a QRadar Console in the {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Operations center.</p>
</dd>
<dt>

## {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_local_notm}} infrastructure requirements
{: #localinfra}

For {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_local_notm}}, you own the physical security and the infrastructure for hosting the local instance.

{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} sets the following minimum requirements for setting up {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_local_notm}}.

### Hardware

While there are requirements for the type and size of available hardware, you can choose any combination to meet the set resource total requirements.

<dl>
<dt>**VMware ESXi hardware**</dt>
<dd>
ESXi is a virtualization layer that runs on physical servers and that abstracts processor, memory, storage, and resources into multiple virtual machines. Choose any combination that meets the following resource totals, on the condition that minimum physical core count per ESXi is eight. The following specifications are for the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} core runtime only.
<ul>
<li>32 physical cores at 2.0 or more GHz each</li>
<li>512 GB of physical RAM</li>
<li>Total datastore size of 7.5 TB
<ul>
<li>7 TB datastore to hold {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}</li>
<li>500 GB datastore to hold the inception virtual machine</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you use multiple datastores, use the same prefix for each.</p>
</dd>
<dt>**High availability**</dt>
<dd>
To support a single node failure, you must have n+1 ESXi. For example, if the 32 core and 512 GB of memory is met using two 16x cores with 256 GB ESXi servers, you need three of these servers to support a complete failure of a single node.
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The customer's VMware administrator can decide to enforce strict high availability failover in the cluster to guarantee resources. If you choose to proceed without high availability failover, you can meet the minimum 32 core and 512 GB resource requirement.</p>
</dd>
<dt>**Network**</dt>
<dd>
Recommended requirements include a customer accessible port group with seven customer network IP addresses that have outbound internet access in the same subnet. Two ports are used by the inception virtual machine, three ports are virtual IP addresses used for the domains, and the final two are public IP addresses for the DataPowers. Then, you define a second private VLAN between only the ESXis being used for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_local_notm}}. This VLAN is shown as a port group in VMware. {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_local_notm}} uses it for the private subnet, which is more secure and can help avoid routing issues.<br />
<p>The following ports are used:</p>
<ul>
<li>Port 443 for the Relay connection
<p>**Note**: If you choose to use an IPSec tunnel instead of an OpenVPN, then you open a customer port for this connection.</p></li>
<li>Port 389 or SSL 636 for the LDAP or Active Directory connection</li>
</ul>
<p>**Note**: {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} can detect if the network connection is lost. In the event that network connection is lost, {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} contacts you and works with your network specialist to resolve the issue.</p>
</dd>
<dt>**Network uplinks**</dt>
<dd>Use two or more interfaces that range from 1 to 10 Gbps, depending on the intended workload for the system.</dd>
</dl>

### vCenter server configuration

Review the following version, datacenter, resource pool, and datastore requirements.

<dl>
<dt>**Supported VMware versions**</dt>
<dd>vCenter and ESXi 5.1, 5.5, and 6.0</dd>
<dt>**Supported VMware types**</dt>
<dd>vSphere Enterprise<br />
vSphere Enterprise plus, if you plan to use distributed virtual switches</dd>
<dt>**Datacenter**</dt>
<dd>Create a datacenter, if one does not exist.</dd>
<dt>**Datacenter folder**</dt>
<dd>Create a VM folder with the same name as the cluster, if you do not plan to grant Administrator access that is propagated from the datacenter.</dd>
<dt>**Cluster**</dt>
<dd>Create a cluster specifically for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_local_notm}} use. An example for the cluster name is `bluemix`.</dd>
<dt>**Resource pool**</dt>
<dd>Create a resource pool under the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_local_notm}} cluster. An example for resource pool name is `local`.</dd>
</dt>**Datastores**</dt>
<dd>Requires 7.5 TB for the initial deployment of {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.<br />
<br />
**Note**: When you use more than one datastore, ensure that each one begins with the same prefix. Examples of multiple datastore names with the same prefix are `bluemix_datastore_01` and `bluemix_datastore_02`.</dd>
<dt>**Network**</dt>
<dd>You must have one customer accessible network with outbound internet capability. The VLAN hosts the private subnet where the Bluemix Local components run. All traffic is routed from the private subnet to the customer subnet. A customer subnet IP is used for all access to Bluemix Local. Then, you can define a second private VLAN between only the ESXis being used for Bluemix Local. This VLAN is shown as a port group in VMware. Bluemix Local uses it for the private subnet, which is more secure and can help avoid routing issues.
<p>If you are using vSphere distributed switches (vDS), create a folder to hold the vDS, and place the vDS inside the folder.</p>
</dl>

### Network Bandwidth for Relay

Recommended throughput is 5 Mbps up and 5 Mbps down, and you can expect a monthly data usage of 10 GB. {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} establishes agreed upon windows when large bundles of data are delivered, which can be as large as 4 GB.

### VMware permissions

Set the following roles and permissions. Propagation is set for each permission. If the permission is propagated, the permission gets passed down through the object hierarchy. However, permissions for a child object always override permissions that are propagated from a parent object.

<dl>
<dt>**vCenter Server**</dt>
<dd>Set the role as read-only and not propagated.<br />
<br />
**Note**: This role is needed to retrieve task status for specific disk operations.</dd>
<dt>**Datacenter**</dt>
<dd>Create the role "{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}" and grant the following permissions:
<ul>
<li>For **Datastore**, set **Low level file operations** and **Update virtual machine files**.</li>
<li>For **vApp**, set **Import**.</li>
<li>For **dvPort** group, set **Modify**. This is for vDS use only.</li>
</ul>
**Note**: This role is needed to support file posts to the datastores.</dd>
<dt>**Cluster**</dt>
<dd>Set the role as administrator and propagated.</dd>
<dt>**Datastores**</dt>
<dd>Set the role administrator and propagated for each {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} datastore.</dd>
<dt>**Network**</dt>
<dd><ul>
<li>For vSwitch, set public and private port groups with the administrator role, not propagated.</li>
<li>For vDS parent folder, set as read-only and propagated.</li>
<li>For vDS, set public and private port groups with the administrator role, not propogated.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>

### Increasing the Droplet Execution Agent (DEA) pool
Each DEA is configured with:
- 16 or 32 GB of RAM
- 2x or 4x vCPU
- 150 or 300 GB of storage

For example, if the ESXi host size is 256 GB of memory with 16x cores, then eight DEAs are added. If the ESXi host size is 64 GB of memory with 8x cores, then two ESXis and four DEAs are required to be added. An additional 1.5 TB of storage is required for every four DEAs. This example is based on a DEA configured with 32 GB of RAM, 4x vCPU, and 300 GB of storage.

## Maintaining your local instance
{: #maintainlocal}

{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} maintains and installs updates and fixes to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} runtimes and services, as {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} deems appropriate. Services might not be available during maintenance windows. In addition, {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} works with you to schedule maintenance updates for the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform.

### {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} maintenance

The following types of maintenance are required for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_local_notm}}:

<dl>
<dt>**Standard maintenance for services**</dt>
<dd>The services utilize pre-defined, standard maintenance windows, which might cause the services to be unavailable. {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} does not require customer approval to perform service maintenance, but attempts to minimize impact to your services.<br />
<br />
{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} sends broadcast messages detailing the changes that are planned for each maintenance window on the Status page.<br />
<br />
**Important**: Some services might not be available to you during the maintenance period.</dd>

<dt>**Standard maintenance for the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform**</dt>
<dd>Maintenance updates are applied based on coordination between you and {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} within a 21-day window. You provide {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} with preapproved maintenance windows and specific dates or times that might not work for you, and {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} works to schedule updates during or around the dates that you selected.<br />
<p>Go to **ADMINISTRATION > SYSTEM INFORMATION** to view scheduled and pending maintenance updates. For more information about setting your preapproved windows, unavailable dates, and viewing or approving scheduled maintenance updates, see <a href="/docs/admin/index.html#oc_schedulemaintenance">Maintenance updates</a>.</p></dd>
</dl>

**Important**: {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} reserves the right to interrupt services to apply emergency maintenance as needed. {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} might change scheduled maintenance hours, but notifies you of any such changes, as well as any emergency maintenance information.

If there is a reported issue following a maintenance update, you agree with {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Support as to whether it is in your best interest to allow {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} to roll back the update. Upon agreement, {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} rolls back the update to restore the environment to the previous state.

### Customer infrastructure maintenance
{: #inframaintenance}

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_local_notm}} is deployed onto the ESXi hypervisor, and the vCenter application is used to centrally manage virtual machines and ESXi hosts. {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} supports the latest three versions of ESXi and vCenter, including all intermediate updates and patches. You can always find the latest supported versions in the [Local infrastructure requirements](/docs/local/index.html#localinfra) documentation.

**Important**: With {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_local_notm}} being deployed onto the ESXi hypervisor, upgrades and patches to ESXi can disrupt the availability of the local environment, including all applications and services running within environment. You must notify {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} by using a support ticket prior to completing an upgrade or patch to ensure that the disruption does not alert the operations team in error. If you have an assigned client success manager (CSM), you can work with the CSM to communicate the upgrade schedule.

To ensure that your local instance is compatible with the latest supported versions, the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Operations team monitors the environment for unsupported versions that might not match the latest {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local environment updates. Some {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} updates, such as Cloud Foundry version updates, require you to update the ESXi or vCenter software. {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} support will alert you regarding what must be updated and by when. You are provided a window of time to complete this update.

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} makes every effort to keep the local environments compatible with the latest ESXi and vCenter versions. However, there might be short periods of time where the most recent ESXi and vCenter versions are not supported. Refer to the [Local infrastructure requirements](/docs/local/index.html#localinfra) documentation for the latest compatible versions prior to applying any updates.

## Disaster recovery for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_local_notm}}

## Disaster recovery
{: #dr}

Disaster recovery for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_short}} Local can be set up similarly to the way that it works when you use {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_short}} Public. {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_short}} Public provides a continuously available platform for innovation with multiple fail-safe measures to ensure that your orgs, spaces, and apps are always available. Deploying apps to multiple geographic regions enables continuous availability that protects against unplanned, simultaneous loss of multiple hardware or software components, or the loss of an entire data center, so that even in the event of a natural disaster in one geographic location, your distributed {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public app instances in alternate geographic locations will be available.
{: shortdesc}

Disaster recovery for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_short}} Local is made possible through continuous availability for your apps, the inherent high availability of the platform, and the ability to restore your instance in the event of a failure. You are responsible for enabling continuous availability of your apps by deploying to multiple regions. High availability is built in at the platform level through technologies included in Cloud Foundry and other components. And, you can work together with {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} to ensure that your data is properly backed up in the case that you need to restore your instance at any time.

### Enabling continuous availability for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_local_notm}}
{: #enabling}

By default, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public deploys to multiple geographic locations. However, you must do the following to enable globally distributed {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_local_notm}} instances:

* Ensure that your developers are deploying apps in more than one region, either through a manual or automated process. Selected regions should be more than 200 km apart from each other to ensure that a natural disaster cannot affect both geographic locations.
* Configure a global load balancer, like Akamai or Dyn, to point to apps in at least two different regions.

**Note**: Not all {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} services support regional distribution. When you construct an app, if you want to achieve geographic distribution, then you must also make sure that the services that are used by that app have data synchronization as a key feature.

#### Deploying {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_local_notm}} apps to multiple geographic locations
{: #deploying}

To deploy into a second location or multiple locations, you must follow a process similar to the one you took to enable your primary geographic location:

1. Enable a new local environment to host additional instances of your applications. To create a new environment, contact your {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} sales team to initiate the process. For more information about setting up a local instance, see [Setting up {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_local_notm}}](/docs/local/index.html#setuplocal). You must log in separately to access each environment. Each physical location for the hosted environments should be a minimum of 200 km away from the original location to ensure availability.
2. Obtain the unique domain name where your new deployed app will be hosted. For example, if your original domain is *mycompany.caeast.bluemix.net*, then you can create a new local environment with a new domain such as *mycompany.cawest.bluemix.net*, and deploy to the new domain.
3. Deploy to the new location each time you deploy your original app. For more information about deploying, see [Uploading your app](/docs/starters/upload_app.html).


#### Enabling a global load balancer for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_local_notm}}
{: #glb}

A global load balancer not only ensures continuous availability and is required for disaster recovery, but it also has several additional benefits:

* Routes users to the closest {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} region by default
* Routes based on performance
* Selectively directs a percentage of traffic to a new application version
* Provides site failover based on region health check
* Provides site failover based on application health check
* Uses weighted routing between endpoints

You can choose a global load balancer such as Akamai or Dyn. For more about using Akamai as a global load balancer, see [Global traffic management](https://www.akamai.com/us/en/solutions/products/web-performance/global-traffic-management.jsp){: new_window}. For more about using Dyn as a global load balancer, see [4 Reasons Businesses Are Taking Global Load Balancing to the Cloud](http://dyn.com/blog/4-reasons-businesses-are-taking-global-load-balancing-to-the-cloud/){: new_window}.

### High availability
{: #ha}

In addition to enabling continuous availability, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} also provides high availability across the platform by using technologies built into Cloud Foundry and other components.

These technologies include the following:

<dl>
<dt>DEA Scalability in Cloud Foundry</dt>
<dd>A Cloud Foundry <a href="https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/architecture/execution-agent.html" target="_blank">Droplet Execution Agent (DEA)</a> performs health checks on the apps running within it. If there is a problem with the app or the DEA itself, it deploys additional instances of the app to an alternate DEA to address the issue. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/high-availability.html" target="_blank">Configuring CF for High Availability with Redundancy</a>.
<p>To ensure high availability for your applications, you need enough compute resources to balance the load, and you might also require additional compute resources to support a possible failure. If you need to scale your environment by increasing your DEA pool to be prepared for a failure or address a spike in the load for your app instances, you can work with your IBM representative to order additional DEAs and ensure that you have the appropriate hardware to support the added resources.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Metadata backup</dt>
<dd>Metadata is backed up to a secondary location, typically an on-premises virtual machine. If possible, you should replicate the backup to your own environment at least 200 km away.</dd>
</dl>

## Restoring your local instance
{: #restorelocal}

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_local_notm}} settings, metadata, and configurations are backed up regularly to prepare for any unplanned outages in the environment. Your data that you are responsible for backing up includes application data, cloud database services data, and object stores.

As part of the data backup, which includes system metadata and configurations, {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} completes the following tasks:

<ul>
<li>Encrypts all backup copies and manages encryption keys</li>
<li>Monitors and manages backup activity</li>
<li>Provides the encrypted backup files</li>
<li>Restores the requested data</li>
<li>Manages scheduling conflicts between backup and fix management operations</li>
</ul>

Because protection of private data is critical, {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} needs your collaboration when dealing with backup file management, so that the files are not moved outside of your data centers. Specifically, {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} asks that you complete the following tasks:

<ul>
<li>Move a copy of your encrypted backup data off-site, just as you would for any other backup data that you manage.</li>
<li>Provide the backup files for the {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} administrator in case of any need to restore.</li>
</ul>
