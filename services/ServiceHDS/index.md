# Getting started with Hybrid Data Service
{: #gettingstartedHDS}


Hybrid Data Service (HDS) is a multi-engine hybrid database as a service, which supports JDBC, Mongo APIs, and Rest APIs for the same data at the same time. The seamless integration for different data access APIs makes HDS perfect for various scenarios such as Internet-of-Things, Internet+, legacy system migration, and etc.
{:shortdesc}

HDS performs special optimizations for time series data. Time series data is usually generated by IoT (Internet of Things) devices, such as metering sensors or temperature sensors. The simple IoT REST APIs, which is based on Unified JSON Time Series Data Model, are provided for IoT applications to store and query huge amount time series sensor data.

To use the Hybrid Data Service (HDS) in your application, you can use the IBM Bluemix user interface or you can do the same from the command line using the CloudFoundry cf tool. You'll need this tool to deploy applications into the Bluemix cloud. Please refer cf tool user guide or bluemix doc to create your own Hybrid Data Service instance and bind the Hybrid Data Service (HDS) instance to your application.

After binding HDS instance to the application, the following configuration is added to your VCAP_SERVICES environment variable (see the HDS credentials below).

```
	{
	  "hybrid_data_service": 
	  [
	  {
		"name": "Hybrid_Data_Service-y9",
		"label": "hybrid_data_service",
		"plan": "small_plan",
		"credentials": 
		{
		  "json_url": "mongodb://iruyzsxu:6DQrw1PhIM@172.18.32.53:27017/d_1463109202675087",
		  "db": "d_1463109202675087",
		  "username": "iruyzsxu",
		  "sql_url": "jdbc:informix-sqli://172.18.32.53:9088/d_1463109202675087:INFORMIXSERVER=ifxserver;USER=iruyzsxu;PASSWORD=6DQrw1PhIM;DB_LOCALE=en_us.utf8",
		  "iot_url": "http://iruyzsxu:6DQrw1PhIM@172.18.32.53:8090/d_1463109202675087",
		  "rest_url": "http://iruyzsxu:6DQrw1PhIM@172.18.32.53:8080/d_1463109202675087",
		  "hostname": "172.18.32.53",
		  "password": "6DQrw1PhIM"
		}
	  }
	  ]       
	}
```
{: screen}

The VCAP_SERVICES environment variable includes the following items:

```
	hybrid_data_service: The name of Hybrid Data Service.
	name: The name of the service instance.
	label: The name of the service.
	plan: The name of the service plan.
	credentials: the info to access the service instance.
	hostname: The IP address of the HDS server.
	db: The database name.
	username: The user name for authentication.
	password: The password for authentication.
	sql_url: The connection URL for Informix JDBC driver.
	json_url: The connection URL for MongoDB connections.
	rest_url: The connection URL for REST connections.
	iot_url: The connection URL for REST connections.
```
{: screen}

The following code snippet for a MongoDB application shows how to obtain the service credential information (json_url) to connect to one HDS service using basic Java code:

```
	import com.mongodb.*;
	import com.mongodb.util.*;
	.....
	String VCAP_SERVICES = System.getenv("VCAP_SERVICES");
	if (VCAP_SERVICES != null) {
		BasicDBObject obj = (BasicDBObject) JSON.parse(VCAP_SERVICES);
		Set<String> keys = obj.keySet();
		for (String eachkey : keys) 
			if (eachkey.contains("hybrid_data_service")) 
				thekey = eachkey;
		BasicDBList list = (BasicDBList) obj.get(thekey);
		obj = (BasicDBObject) list.get("0");
		BasicDBObject credentialObj = (BasicDBObject) obj.get("credentials");
		databaseHost = (String) credentialObj.get("hostname");
		databaseName = (String) credentialObj.get("db");
		username = (String) credentialObj.get("username");
		password = (String) credentialObj.get("password");
		connectionUrl = (String) credentialObj.get("json_url");
	}

## Samples to Use JDBC, MongoDB API and Rest API to Access Hybrid Data Service
{: #samplesaccessHDS}

This section provides simple program using of Informix JDBC API Java, MongoDB API, REST API or IoT REST API to connect to the Hybrid Data Service.

The main steps are:
1. get url string from VCAP_SERVICES environment variable 
2. connect by API
3. operating on HDS
4. close the connection

Tips:

The service credential information is obtained from the environment variable "VCAP_SERVICES" and assigned to credentialObj (see the code snippet above).
	
### IBM Informix JDBC API example(create a table)

```
	public class HSD_JDBC_Test {
     public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException, JSONException, SQLException { 
       //obtain credentialObj from VCAP_SERVICES
       BasicDBObject credentialObj = ......

       //Get JDBC url string
       String URL = credentialObj.getString("sql_url");
       System.out.print("url = " + URL + "\n");
     
       //Connect
       Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(URL);
       System.out.print("success to connect to the HDS by JDBC!\n");
       conn.setAutoCommit(true);
     
       //Try to create a table
       Statement st = conn.createStatement();
       String sql = "create table if not exists testtable(id int, str char(50))";
       st.execute(sql);
       st.close();
       System.out.print("success to run : " + sql + "\n");
     
       //Close connection

## REST API for HDS
{: #restapiHDS}

The REST API for HDS is a powerful and flexible way to interact with your database. With the REST API, you can use MongoDB and SQL queries against JSON and BSON document collections, traditional relational tables, and time series data. The REST API uses MongoDB syntax and returns JSON documents.

The REST API supports HTTP GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE methods, using MongoDB syntax, return JSON data.

Use rest_url in Credentials to perform REST operations in HDS.

The REST API is fully documented ["REST API in IBM Knowledge Center"](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGU8G_12.1.0/com.ibm.json.doc/ids_json_043.html){:new_window}.

- GET

    GET rest_url  List collections.

    GET rest_url/collectionName  Query the collection.

    GET rest_url/collectionName?queryParameters  Query the collection with condition. The supported queryParameters are batchSize, query, fields, and sort.

- PUT

    PUT rest_url/collectionName?queryParameters  Insert/update data in the collection.

- POST

    POST rest_url  Create a collection.

    POST rest_url/collectionName  Create a document.

- DELETE

    DELETE rest_url/collectionName  Delete a collection.

    DELETE rest_url/collectionName?queryParameters  Delete all documents that satisfy the query from a collection.
	
## IoT REST API for HDS
{: #iotrestapiHDS}

The IoT REST API is a very simple API designed for IoT applications to manage devices with time series data. The popolar IoT devices include sensors that can generate continuous time series data.

IoT REST API is based on three pre-created tables (iot_device, iot_devicedata, iot_devicedata_ts). When a database is created, these three tables are created automatically. Users should not take any action on the three tables,  otherwise IoT REST API may not run correctly.
 
The IoT REST API has a predefined device schema, which includes 5 elements:

```
	id: The UUID of the device.
	key:User-defined unique ID. This key is a unique constraint.
	description:Describes the content of this time series in human-readable format.
	metadata:A JSON document that describes this time series. The field is often used to describe the device that captured the data. It includes information such as the manufacturer, model number, and location. This document must not contain subdocuments or arrays, that is, it must be flat.
	data: Time series data generated by the device.
```
{: screen} 

Example:

```
	{
	   "id": "7c1c1197-c011-4169-a0d1-97685b96054b",
	   "key": "building.1.floor.2.sensor",
	   "description": "sensor to get temperature, pressure, et cetera",
	   "metadata": {
				   "building": "1",,
				   "floor": "2"
	   },
	   "data": [
			{
			"t": "2014-01-08T00:00:00.000",
			"temperature": 33,
			"humidity": 45
			},
			{
			"t": "2014-01-08T01:00:00.000",
			"temperature": 34,
			"humidity": 50
			}
	   ]
	}
```
{: screen} 

You can query time series data with IoT REST API. The IoT REST API supports HTTP GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE methods, using MongoDB syntax, return JSON data.
 
Use iot_url in Credentials to perform IOT REST operations in HDS.

- GET

    GET iot_url   List devices.

    GET iot_url?  Query devices that meet the query constraints.

- PUT

    PUT iot_url  Store time series data on the device.


- POST

    POST iot_url  Create a device with metadata (register a device).

- DELETE

    DELETE iot_url? Delete devices that meet the query constraints.
	
## IOT REST API Examples
{: #iotrestapiExamples}

### Create a device with metadata (Register a device)

Use 'POST iot_url' to register a device. The POST payload is a structural json document. The request payload consists of four elements: 'id', 'key', 'description' and 'metadata'. The 'id' and 'key' in the time series model must be unique. The 'id', 'description' and 'metadata' are optional. If there is no 'id' in the request, the HDS will generate an unique id and return it in the response.

All IoT REST APIs must be authenticated by username and password with 'basic-auth' method.

Creating Example:

Register a temperature sensor. In the example, `http://dgzbbwwa:4raD5M9JIB@172.18.32.53:8090/d_1461161444275608` is refered to `iot_url`. 


	HTTP Request:

```
		POST http://dgzbbwwa:4raD5M9JIB@172.18.32.53:8090/d_1461161444275608
		HEADER:
			Content-type: application/json; charset=UTF-8
			Authorization: authorizationString
			Accept: application/json
		POST BODY:
		{
			"id": "H1xxlXyT",
			"key": "IBMabcdefghi845dd7dev005abcdefgh",
			"description": "sensor to get temperature and pressure",
			"metadata": {  
				"name":"test1",
				"typename":"tester",
				"version":"1.0",
				"manufacturedate":"12/22/2015",
				"registerdate":"12/22/2015"
		   }
		}
```
{: screen} 

	HTTP Response:
```
		{"id": "H1xxlXyT", "ok": true}
```
{: screen}


### Query device data

Use 'GET iot_url?' to query a device data. The supported paremeters in HTTP URL are shown below:

```
		id: specify the device id to retrieve data from
		key: specify the device key to retrieve data from
		metadata: filter documents with keys in metadata
		fields: specify the fields to include in the response
		start: start time, ISO_8601 format or long (milliseconds)
		end: end time, ISO_8601 format or long (milliseconds)
		dataFormat: the returned timestamp's format
```
{: screen} 
 

IoT REST API supports several timestamp format below:

- millisecond (the difference between January 1, 1970 and current time)

> regular expression:"^(\+|-)?\d+L$"

> example:
123456789L
+123L

- Year 

> regular expression:"^\d{4}$"

> example: 
2015

- Year-Month

> regular expression:"^\d{4}$"

> example: 
2015


- Year-Month-Day

> example:
2016-05-30

- Year-Month-Day Hour:Minute

> example:
2016-05-30 12:00

- Year-Month-Day Hour:Minute:Second

> example:
2016-05-30 12:00:00

- Year-Month-Day Hour:Minute:Second.Fraction

> example:
2016-05-30 12:00:00.000

In the request, 'start' and 'end' should use date format above.
'dataFormat' is used to descript returned timestamp's format, usually 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss' and 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss:SSS' will be set.


The response is the JSON array document, which follows the predefined device schema.
