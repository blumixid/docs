# Best practices for setting up your organizations and spaces
{: #patterns}

For a successful project, you must take time to plan, design, and decide what resources you need and what your enterprise requirements are. To help you get started with your 
cloud project, consider the following questions:

* How many, and what type of, applications will be developed?
* Which services will the applications need to access?
* Who will be collaborating in the development process and what role will they play?
* What degree of isolation is required for each phase of the project?
* Will your enterprise supply the infrastructure resources? 
* Is there a naming standard that you can implement to clearly identify the organization and space usage?   

{:shortdesc}

When you design a cloud solution, you must also take into account security and operational requirements, country regulations, market directives, and corporate policies. 
To cater for your project needs, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} offers three types of cloud environments. 

| Type of cloud   | Cloud description |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public](/docs/overview/whatisbluemix.html "{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public") | The infrastructure resources are shared by different companies and users.|
| [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated](/docs/dedicated/index.html#dedicated "{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated") | You use your own dedicated SoftLayer infrastructure, which you can connect securely to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public cloud and your own network.|
| [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local](/docs/local/index.html#local "{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local") | Sits behind your company firewall, which can protect your most sensitive workloads and can connect securely to both {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public and {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated clouds.|
Table 1. {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} cloud types
{: #bptable1}

Apart from deciding the type of cloud environment, you must plan the structure of your account, organizations, spaces, resources, and team members. The folllowing table provides a 
summary of some of the key {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} elements. 

| {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} element   | Description |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Account   | Each account has one account owner. |
|| Contains one or more organizations. You must have a Pay-As-You-Go account to create more than one organization. |
| Account owner   | Responsible for all of the usage charges that are accumulated within the account. |
|| Can own only one account. |
|| Can add one or more organization managers to delegate the org management, which includes the read and write permissions to the organizations. |
|| Can be a team member in organizations and spaces in other {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} accounts. |
| Organization   | Contains one or more spaces. | 
|| Contains one or more org managers. |
|| Contains one or more team members. Each team member can be granted one or more roles. |
|| The usage charges, which are generated by a deployed application within a space, are reported at the organization level. |
| Space   | Contains one or more resources. |
|| Only one application can be deployed within a space. |
|| Contains one or more space managers. |
|| Contains one or more team members. Each team member can be granted one or more roles. |
| Team member   | Can be added to one or more organizations and spaces across different accounts. |
|| Can be given more than one role within the same organization, space, or both. |

## Determining your organization structure
{: #orgstructure}

To design a cloud environment that uses {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local, 
or any combination, you can use the following organization patterns:

* Single-organization pattern
* Multi-organization pattern

If you require the same set of users to access resources that are available anywhere in the organization either in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public, 
{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated, or {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local, consider using the single organization pattern.

If you require isolation between different environments within {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated, or 
{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local, consider using the multi-organization pattern.

### Single-organization versus multi-organization
{: #singleormulti}

There is an important difference between the two organization patterns. In a single-organization environment, the infrastructure resources are shared by different areas of 
the company. Whereas, in a multi-organization environment the infrastructure resources are not shared. 

Both organization patterns support the following priciples:

* Isolation of applications, projects, or both.
* Authorization to manage resources granted by user role.

To implement a single-organization architecture, create an account in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated, or 
{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local, and define one organization. You can then define multiple spaces that are based on different lines of business (LOB), 
the delivery phases, specific projects, applications, user permisisons, or a combination of these components.

To implement a multi-organization architecture, create an account in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated, 
or {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local. Next, you can define organizations that correspond to different lines of business (LOB), delivery phases, 
specific projects, user permisisons, or a combination of these components. You can then define multiple spaces that are based on applications or projects that are 
delivered by the same department in the company. 

Now that you have your account and one or more organizations defined, you can think about the following {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} elements:

| {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} element | Where to find more information |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Organizations | [Single-organization guidance](#singleorg) and [Multi-organization guidance](#multiorg) |
| Spaces | [Single space guidance](#singlespace) and [Multiple space guiance](#multispace) |
| Team members | [Assigning roles guidance](#roles) |

### Organization isolation and abstraction
{: #orgconsiderations}

{: #singleorg}
When you adopt a single-organization architecture, the organization includes all of the cloud resources, services, and applications that you use to develop, manage, and 
deploy cloud applications. In {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public, the organization provides isolation between accounts and is available across all regions.

 ![Figure that shows the single-organization architecture in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}](/docs/admin/images/multi_F3.gif "Figure that shows the 
 single-organization architecture in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}")

 Figure 1. Example of a single-organization architecture for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated, and 
 {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local 
{: #bpfigure1}

{: #multiorg}
When you adopt a multi-organization architecture, organizations provide the first level of isolation and abstraction that you can use to control and define what can be 
done and by whom. Design each organization around the different lines of business (LOB), the delivery phases, the roles of the users, specific projects, or a 
combination of these components.  

The number of organizations that you require depends on multiple factors:

* The level of granularity that you require within your organization to manage quotas and control costs.
* The level of security that you must enforce in your different environments. For example, if you are using containers, you might want to isolate container images that are 
used for development from the container images that are used for production.
* The location of the organizations due to corporate, country, and industry requirements. For example, you might want to run all of your apps in a dedicated cloud that is 
located in a specific region in your geography (geo).

When you are defining the different organizations for your cloud structure, consider the following guidance:

* Define and then enforce a naming convention. For example, define a naming convention where the name of the organization includes information about the business area, 
the type of cloud ({{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local, or {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated), and the 
process phase (development, testing, or production). For organizations that are located in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public, you might want to add information 
about the region too.
* Define the restrictions that apply to the organization. For example, define the role of the team members that are going to work in that organization.
* Identify the manager of the organization.
* Identify the area of the business that is allocated to this organization.

The following scenarios show different approaches that you can adopt when you define the number of {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} organizations in a cloud environment:
* Scenario 1: Isolation of users by delivery phase

  Description: You have different sets of users that need to work in the development environment, the test environment, and the production environment.

  Solution: You can create organizations based on the type of IT work. For example, one organization for development, one for testing, and one for production.

  ![Figure that shows isolation of users by delivery phase in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public ](/docs/admin/images/multi_F1.gif "Figure that shows isolation of users by delivery phase in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public")

  Figure 2. Example of a multi-organization architecture aligned to delivery phases in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public 
{: #bpfigure2}
* Scenario 2: Isolation based on type of users (internal users, external users)

  Description: Your company works with different partners. You require different applications for internal users and for external ones.

  Solution: You can create organizations to develop, test, and run applications that are used internally. In addition, you can create one or more organizations per partner.

* Scenario 3: Isolation by project

  Description: Your company runs hackathons to identify new services.  

  Solution: You can define one organization per hackathon and use the organization as a sandbox. After the hackathon, you can promote the sandbox organization into an additional organization in your account.

* Scenario 4: Isolation of users by LOB and delivery phase

  Description: Corporate rules require that development, test, and production users must be different. In addition, the apps of each LOB must be developed, managed, and deployed by different users. Security must be enforced so that users can access only the apps that are relevant to their part of the business.

  Solution: You can create organizations by LOB and then by type of environment, for example, you can create one organization for the development of applications for the billing department, one for testing the billing applications, and one for running the billing applications in production.

  ![Figure that shows isolation of users by LOB and delivery phase in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated ](/docs/admin/images/multi_F2.gif "Figure that shows isolation of users by LOB and delivery phase in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated")

   Figure 3. Example of a multi-organization architecture aligned with LOB and delivery phases for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated 
{: #bpfigure3}

### Organization naming, restrictions, and management 
{: #orgadmin}   
   
Before you start to define the different organizations for your cloud environment, consider the following guidance:

* Define and enforce a naming convention. For example, define a naming convention where the name of the organization includes information about the business area, 
the type of cloud ({{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local, or {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated), and the 
IT role (development, testing, or production). For organizations that are located in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public, you might want to add information 
about the region too.
* Define the restrictions that apply to the organization. For example, define the role of each of the team members and the permissions they need to work in that organization.
* Identify the manager of the organization. You might want to delegate the organization administration to more that one person. 
* Identify the area of the business that is allocated to this organization. The application usage that is generated in each of the spaces, within the organization, 
is accumulated and reported at the organization level. 

## Determining your spaces
{: #determinespaces}

Within an organization, spaces provide an additional level of isolation and abstraction.

A space is a reserved area in the organization where users can develop and run applications and services. You can create any number of spaces in an organization. 
You can control the users that have access to a space. For more information, see [Spaces](/docs/admin/orgs_spaces.html#spaceinfo "Spaces").

### Spaces for single-organization versus multi-organization
{: #spaceconsiderations}

{: #singlespace}
When you adopt a single-organization architecture, the level of isolation and abstraction is provided by the spaces that you define within the organization. Consider the following guidance when you define spaces:

* Define a space to host a service that requires provisioning and configuring only once in the organization.
* Define spaces based on the delivery lifecycle.
  For example, you can define one or more spaces for applications that are being developed, one or more spaces for applications that are in the test phase, and one or more 
  spaces for applications that are in production.
* If the isolation by delivery lifecycle is not sufficient, you can achieve more isolation by defining one or more spaces per LOB and delivery phase.
* If you require isolation by sets of users, define a space for each set of users.
  For example, your developers cannot test the application and test it. You require a different set of users to test it. In this scenario, you create two spaces, one for 
  developers of the application and one for testers of the application. Then grant each set of users access to the correct space.

{: #multispace}
When you adopt a multi-organization architecture, you can isolate each organization by the delivery lifecycle phase, by line of business, or both. You can then define 
multiple spaces, which are based on the number of applications or projects that are delivered by the same department in the company. Consider the following guidance when you 
plan the spaces in an organization:

* Define a space to host a service that requires provisioning and configuring only once in the organization.
  For example, if you want to connect applications securely that run in one of your organizations to on-premises or in cloud locations, use the 
  [{{site.data.keyword.SecureGateway}} service](https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/2015/03/27/bluemix-secure-gateway-yes-can-get/ "{{site.data.keyword.SecureGateway}} service"). {{site.data.keyword.SecureGateway}} provides secure connectivity and establishes a tunnel between your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} organization and the remote location that you want to connect to. You only need to provision once, but you can configure multiple destinations for this service in your organization.  
* Define a space per application, per group of related applications, or for a specific project.
* If you require isolation by sets of users, define a space for each set of users.
  In {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public, for example, you can provision within a space of an organization any of the following resources: Cloud Foundry applications, 
  Docker containers that run in {{site.data.keyword.containerlong}}, virtual servers that run in {{site.data.keyword.virtualmachineslong}}, and 
  {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} services. When a user is granted a developer role in a space, that user has full access to any resources (containers, virtual 
  servers, Cloud Foundry apps, and {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} services) that are provisioned and running in that space. When you need to enforce tighter security to prevent  
  that users that manage Cloud Foundry applications from managing containers or virtual servers, consider defining different spaces to run containers, virtual servers, and 
  Cloud Foundry applications. Within any of these spaces, you can provison {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} services that might be used by the apps running in that space.

### Space naming, restrictions, and management  
{: #spaceadmin} 
 
Before you define the different spaces for your cloud organization, consider the following guidance:

* Define and enforce a naming convention. For example, define a naming convention where the space name includes information about where the organization is located 
and the type of cloud ({{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated, or {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local).
* Define the restrictions that apply to the space. For example, define the type of applications that can be developed, managed, and deployed in each space.
* Identify the manager of the space. You might want to delegate the space administration to more that one person. 

## Determining quota for an organization
{: #determinequota}

When you create an organization in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, you provision infrastructure resources that include resources such as memory, Internet Protocol (IP), 
servers, and storage:
*	For {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public, a minimum set of resources is allocated by IBM to an organization. Based on the type of account, you have different 
resource allocations. These resources define the quota that is allocated by IBM to an organization.
*	For {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated, you request a set of resources from IBM, and then you can distribute them between the different organizations in your 
{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated cloud environment.
*	For IBM Local, you provide the resources and then you can distribute them between organizations in your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local cloud environment.

For {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public and {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated, you can request additional resources from IBM. For 
{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local, you are responsible for providing any resources that might be required to run your business in the local cloud.

The quota that is allocated to an organization represents the resources that are available within the organization. You manage the quota and you decide 
how the resources are distributed across the organization. For example, in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public, different quota limits are set 
for working with Cloud Foundry apps, {{site.data.keyword.containerlong}}, and {{site.data.keyword.virtualmachineslong}}. You manage resources by type of 
infrastructure and distribute them according to your requirements:
*	You can manage the number of services that are allocated to a space in Cloud Foundry.
*	You can manage the memory, the public IP addresses, and the file shares (storage) that are allocated to a space and can be used by applications that run in 
{{site.data.keyword.containerlong}}.
*	You can manage the memory, the public IP addresses, and the servers that are allocated to a space and can be used by apps that run in {{site.data.keyword.virtualmachineslong}}.

### Managing and monitoring quota 
{: #managequota}

You manage and monitor the quota of an account by space and by compute infrastructure. Any resource that is provisioned in a space and is then used by the deployed application consumes a portion of the quota available to the organization.
* For more information about how to view and manage the quota of an organization in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public, see [Managing quota](/docs/admin/orgs_spaces.html#managequota "Managing quota").
* For more information about how to view and manage the quota of an organization in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated or {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} local, see [Viewing usage and reports](/docs/admin/index.html?pos=2#oc_resource "Viewing usage and reports").

### Multi-organization, single-organization, and naming 
{: #multiorgquota}

In a multi-organization architecture, you define the number of organizations based on the different lines of business (LOB), the delivery phases, specific projects, 
user permisisons, or a combination of these components. For example, when you define the level of granularity for an organization at the LOB and delivery phase, and the number 
of spaces by project, you can identify the resources that are used for the development, test, and production phases for projects that are the responsibility of a LOB. You can 
also monitor the resources that are allocated to each project by viewing the space quota. In a single-organization architecture, to obtain the same level of detail, the 
criteria for defining spaces should consider isolation by LOB, delivery phase, and project. The naming convention for each space should facilitate the identification of the 
project including information about the LOB, the phase in the delivery lifecycle, and the project.

Whether you adopt a multi-organization architecture or a single-organization architecture, use a naming convention for spaces that easily identifies and shows the 
quota allocation that is required.   

## Assigning roles
{: #roles}

You can grant multiple roles to team members in a {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account. These roles define the permissions of the user to manage account and organization 
resources:
* You can grant [user roles](/docs/admin/users_roles.html#userrolesinfo "user roles" ) to members of an organization. These roles define the level of access within the 
organization, and restrict who can access a space and its resources. For example, you can grant users different permissions to different spaces.
* In {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated and {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local only, you can grant [administrative roles](/docs/admin/index.html#oc_useradmin "administrative roles" ) 
to members of an account to manage system information, usage of account resources, reports and logs, catalog services, users, and resource usage per organization.

### Account owner
{: #accountowner}

Whether you design a multi-organization architecture or a single-organization architecture, the account owner is the super user of the cloud environment.

The account owner core tasks include:

* Managing the resources of the global account.
* Creating organizations.
* Adding team members to the account.

To add team members to an account, use the email address of the user or a list of email addresses. In {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated and {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} 
Local, you can also use the company LDAP to add users, groups of users, or both. You can also import users from a file. For more information, see [Managing users and permissions](/docs/admin/index.html#oc_useradmin "Managing users and permissions").

The account owner can also perform the following tasks:

* Add one or more users as managers of an organization by assigning these users the **Manager** role. Consider adding a minimum of two users as organization managers. 
The first user acts as the principal manager of the organization. The second user acts as the deputy manager, in case, the principal manager is unavailable.
* In {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public, and depending on the [account type](/docs/pricing/index.html#pay-accounts "account type"), setting spending notifications. First, 
the account owner defines the thresholds that are used to alert him when costs reach a certain limit. Then, [configures email notifications](/docs/admin/account.html#notifications "configures email notifications"). The account manager can use the information in the emails as alert notifications and might take action based on the information provided, for example upgrading the account. **Note:** The account owner is the only person that can receive spending notification emails.
* In {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated or {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local,
* Add one or more users as administrators of the account by assigning these users the **Admin** role. Consider adding a minimum of two users. The first user acts as 
the principal administrator of the account. The second user acts as the deputy administrator.
* Define the account notifications to inform about maintenance updates or critical incident alerts. These notifications can be configured to send an email or a Short Message Service.

### User roles
{: #userroles}

User roles define the permissions that you can assign to a team member in an organization and define the level of access that a team member has within the organization and each space.

In a multi-organization architecture or in a single-organization architecture, define the team members and the permissions that each user requires to complete their work:

1. Identify the set of users that require access to an organization.
2. Define the permissions for each team member in the organization and in a space of the organization.
3. Select the role that grants a user the permissions they require.
   * [Manager role for an organization](#manager)
   * Auditor role for an organization](#orgauditor)
   * [Billing role for an organization](#orgbilling)
   * [Manager role for a space](#spmanager)
   * [Developer role for a space](#dev)
   * [Auditor role for a space](#spauditor)

{: #manager}
The organization manager is responsible for creating spaces, distributing the quota between the spaces, inviting team members and optionally granting them specific roles, 
and defining custom domains. The following list outlines the tasks of an organization manager:

1. Create the spaces that are required for the project. To easily identify what each space is used for, consider adopting and enforcing a naming convention.
2. Distribute the quota between the spaces based on the type of application that will be running in each space.
3. Invite team members to the organization.
5. For each organization, grant the **Billing Manager** role to the team members who will monitor the resource usage charges.
6. For each organization and space, grant the **Auditor** role to the team members who will be responsible for reporting the overall use and efficiency.
4. To delegate the authority, for each space, grant the space **Manager** role to at least one team member.
7. [Set the namespace for the {{site.data.keyword.containerlong}} image registry](/docs/containers/container_planning_org_ov.html#container_planning_namespace "Set the namespace for the {{site.data.keyword.containerlong}} image registry") in the organization. **Note:** The namespace must be unique and can be created only once for an organization. After the namespace is created it cannot be changed. This step is only required if you plan to work with {{site.data.keyword.containerlong}}.
8. Define the domains.

{: #orgauditor}
The team members with the organization **Auditor** role can monitor the quota, the resource usage, and the team members for all of the spaces in an organization. 
The auditors can then report on the organization efficiency and highlight any potential problems.

* When you adopt a multi-organization architecture, you might want to grant the auditor role to the same team members for every organization that is part of the account. 
Then, these team members can monitor the quota across all of the organizations in your cloud environment and obtain a global view of the account.
* When you adopt a single-organization architecture, grant the auditor role to the team members with the responsibility for monitoring the quota usage and overall efficiency 
of the organization.

{: #orgbilling}
The team members with the **Billing Manager** role can monitor the costs of an organization.

* When you adopt a multi-organization architecture, you might want to grant the billing role to the same set of team members for every organization that is part of the account. Then, these team members can then monitor the cost of each organization and obtain a global view of the account.
* In a single-organization architecture, identify the users that are responsible for monitoring the cost.

{: #spmanager}
The space **Manager** is responsible for any work that is done within the space that they manage and control. The space manager can perform the following tasks:

* Monitoring the quota that is allocated to the space.
* Requesting additional resources to the organization manager.
* Notifying the organization manager of resources that are not required.
* Addind team members to the space with the **Developer** role.
* Optionally, assigning the space **Manager** role to a team member to act as a deputy space manager in their absence.

{: #dev}
In {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public, developers are team members with the **Developer** role in a space. These team members have permission to do any of the 
following tasks within the space:

* Manage Cloud Foundry applications.
* Manage Docker containers that run in {{site.data.keyword.containerlong}}.
* Manage virtual servers that run in {{site.data.keyword.virtualmachineslong}}.
* Provision and configure {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} services.
* Associate domains to applications.

In {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated and {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local, the developers are also users that are granted access to a space and are 
assigned the developers role. These users can do any of the following tasks within the space:

* Manage Cloud Foundry applications.
* Provision and configure {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} services.
* Associate domains to applications.

{: #spauditor}
For every space, you might want to grant the space **Auditor** role to the same team members with the organization **Auditor** role. In your enterprise, this role might 
have to be granted to a specific set of users.

### Administrative roles
{: #adminroles}

[Administrative roles](/docs/admin/index.html#oc_useradmin "Administrative roles" ) define the permissions that you can grant to users to manage a {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated or a {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local account. 
You can grant read or write permissions to allow a user to view system information, usage of the account resources, reports and logs, catalog services, users, and resource usage per organization.

In a multi-organization architecture or in a single-organization architecture, define the users and the permissions that each user requires to manage the account:

1. Identify the set of administration cloud team users and fgrant them the relevant administration permissions. Include the organization managers as members of this team.
2. Define the permissions for these users in the account. Divide permissions to manage the catalog and reports between users of the team.
3. Select one or more roles for each user to match the permissions required to manage the account:

   * Admin role: Grant this role to two more users in the account. Users with this role have the authority to manage the entire organization.
   * User role: This role can be configured with read or write permissions. Grant this role with write permissions to managers of organizations to allow them to add users to the account and their organizations. Grant this role with read permissions to managers of organizations that might need access to see the list of members in the account.
   * Catalog role: This role can be configured with read or write permissions. Grant this role to a set of users with write permissions to allow them to define and manage which Bluemix services and starters are visible to users in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Catalog. Grant this role with read permissions to managers of organizations.
   * Reports role: This role can be configured with read or write permissions. Grant this role to a set of users with write permissions to allow them to view and add reports that other users with read permissions can download. Grant read permissions to all members of the admin team.
   * Login role: Grant this role to all members of the admin team. You can also grant this role to other users in the account that require access to view the account notifications and system information.
