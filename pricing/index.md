##How you are charged
{: #charges}

With a {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Paid plan account, you are charged for the compute and services that are used in your organization. You might be invited by other {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} users to participate in organizations under a different account. If you create applications or use services in the organizations that you are invited to, the usage incurred is charged to the account that contains those organizations. You can see more information about a specific charges on a resource details page from the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Catalog, or on the price calculator from the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Pricing page.

Different types of charges apply depending on the features of {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} you are using. The following table provides a high-level overview:

| Type of charge | Description | {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} features that use this type of charge | 
|------------------|------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| Fixed | Fixed-rate pricing is based on an agreed upon monthly charge that is not adjusted. | Services  |
| Metered | Metered-usage pricing is based on the number of GB-hours consumed for runtimes, and on the number of GB-hours consumed and the number of IP addresses and storage for containers. | Services and Compute | 
|  Tiered   |  Some pricing plans are based on a tiered pricing model, so you can get a volume-based discount according to your actual usage. Services might offer simple, graduated, or block tier pricing plans. | Services | 
| Reserved | Reserved pricing is based on a long-term commitment for a service, so you can get a discounted price. With a reserved plan, you get a dedicated service instance that is easy to set up, deploy, and deliver in the public {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} environment. | Services | 


###Charges for compute resources
{: #compute}

You are charged for the time that your applications run and the memory that is used, calculated as *GB-hours*. GB-hours is the calculation of the number of application instances, multiplied by the memory per instance, multiplied by the hours that the instances run. You can customize the number of instances and the amount of memory per instance based on your needs. You can also add memory or instances to scale for more users. The final charge is per GB-hour: your application instances, multiplied by memory per instance, multiplied by hours running.

For example, consider a runtime that costs 0.07 CNY per GB-hour in two 512 MB instances, running for 30 days (720 hours). These resources would cost 24.15 CNY, including a free allowance of 375 GB-hours, with the following calculations: 

```
2 instances x 0.5 GB x 720 hours = 720 GB-hours.
(720 - 375) GB-hours x 0.07 per GB-hour = 24.15
```

###Charges for services
{: #services}

Many services include monthly free allowances. Usage of services that is not included as part of the free allowance is charged in one of the following ways:
<dl>
<dt>Fixed charges</dt>
    <dd>You select a plan and pay on a flat rate basis. For example, the Data Cache service is charged at a flat-rate.</dd>
<dt>Metered charges</dt>
    <dd>You pay based on your runtime and service consumption. For example, with the Push service, any usage over the free monthly allowance is charged.</dd>
<dt>Reserved charges</dt>
    <dd><p>As the account owner of a Subscription account, you can reserve a service instance, with a long-term commitment, for a discounted price.</p> 
    <p>Some {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} services offer reserved plans. You can request a reserved plan from the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} <strong>Catalog</strong> by clicking the tile of the service. Then, select the service plan that best meets your needs. If a reserved plan is available, click <strong>Request</strong>, and follow the prompts to send your request. You will receive an email that contains the price information of the reserved plan. A {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} sales representative will also contact you soon to complete the purchase.</p></dd>
<dt>Tiered charges</dt>
    <dd>Similar to metered charges, you pay based based on your runtime and service consumption. However, Tiered charges add additional pricing tiers, often offering discounted charges in tiers with larger consuption. Tiered pricing is offered in simple, graduated, or block.</dd>
</dl>


####Simple tier
{: #simple_tier}

In the simple tier model, the unit price is determined by the tier that the quantity of your usage falls into. The total price is your quantity multiplied by the unit price in that tier. For example:

| Quantity of items | Unit price for all items |
|-------------------|--------------------------|
| Tier 1: 1 - 1000  | 1 CNY                   |
| Tier 2: 1001 - 2000    |    0.90 CNY                      |
| Tier 3: 2001 - 3000                  |   0.75 CNY                       |
| Tier 4: 3001 - 4000           |      0.60 CNY                    |
|Tier 5: &gt; 4000 | 0.40 CNY | 

*Table 1. Simple tier pricing table*

The following table illustrates how much you pay with a plan that is based on a simple tier pricing model:

| Quantity of items | Charge Calculation | Total Price |
|-------------------|--------------------|-------------|
|500 |	500 Ã— 1 = 500 |	500 CNY|
|1500 |	1500 Ã— 0.90 = 1350 |	1350 CNY|
|2500 |	2500 Ã— 0.75 = 1875 |	1875 CNY|
|... |	... |	...|
|5200 |	5200 Ã— 0.40 = 2080 | 2080 CNY|
*Table 2. Charge calculation by using the simple tier pricing model*

####Graduated tier
{: #graduated_tier}

In the graduated tier model, the unit price per tier decreases as your level of usage increases. The total price is the cumulative charges for each level of usage, consisting of your quantity multiplied by the unit price at that tier. For example:

| Quantity of items |	Unit price for items in the tier|
|-------------------|------------------------------------|
|    Tier 1: 1 - 1000 |	1 CNY |
|   Tier 2: 1001 - 2000 |	0.90 CNY |
|    Tier 3: 2001 - 3000 |	0.75 CNY |
|    Tier 4: 3001 - 4000 |	0.60 CNY |
|    Tier 5: &gt; 4000 |	0.40 CNY |
*Table 3. Graduated tier pricing table*

The following table illustrates how much you pay with a plan that is based on a graduated tier pricing model:

|Quantity of items | Charge calculation | Total price|
|------------------|--------------------|------------|
|500 |	500 Ã— 1 (unit price for Tier 1) = 500 |	500 CNY|
|1500 |	(1000 Ã— 1 (unit price for Tier 1)) + (500 Ã— 0.90 (unit price for Tier 2)) = 1450 |	1450 CNY|
|2500 |	(1000 Ã— 1 (unit price for Tier 1)) + (1000 Ã— 0.90 (unit price for Tier 2)) + (500 Ã— 0.75 (unit price for Tier 3)) = 2275 |	2275 CNY |
|... |	... |	...|
|5200 |	(1000 Ã— 1 (unit price for Tier 1)) + (1000 Ã— 0.90 (unit price for Tier 2)) + (1000 Ã— 0.75 (unit price for Tier 3)) + (1000 Ã— 0.60 (unit price for Tier 4)) + (1200 Ã— 0.40 (unit price for Tier 5)) = 3730 |	3730 CNY|
*Table 4. Charge calculation by using the graduated tier pricing model*

####Block tier
{: #block_tier}

In the block tier model, the price is a set charge for the quantity you use within a usage level. The total price is the charge for your level of usage, regardless of your actual usage. Each successive tier provides a lower price to quantity ratio. For example:

|Quantity of items |	Total price for all items|
|------------------|-----------------------------|
| Tier 1: &lt;= 1000 |	1000 CNY|
| Tier 2: &lt;= 2000 |	1900 CNY|
| Tier 3: &lt;= 3000 |	2800 CNY|
| Tier 4: &lt;= 4000 |	3500 CNY|
| Tier 5: &lt;= 10000 |	5000 CNY|
*Table 5. Block tier pricing table*

The following table illustrates how much you pay with a plan that is based on a block tier pricing model:

|Quantity of items |	Charge calculation |	Total price|
|------------------|-----------------------|---------------|
|500 |	The number of items falls into Tier 1, so the total price is 1000 CNY. |	1000 CNY|
|1500 |	The number of items falls into Tier 2, so the total price is 1900 CNY. |	1900 CNY|
|... |	... |	...|
|5200 |	The number of items falls into Tier 5, so the total price is 5000 CNY. |	5000 CNY|
*Table 6. Charge calculation by using the block tier pricing model*


##Estimating your costs
{: #cost}

You can use different methods to know how much you need to pay for using {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} to build and host your app.

* The cost estimators on the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Pricing page provides a rough estimation of the cost based on the size of your app.
* The cost calculator on the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Pricing page provides accurate app prices based on your input of runtime and service usages.
* You can also calculate your cost manually.

###Using the cost calculators
{: #calculator}

You can quickly price your app by using the cost calculators that are provided by {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.

1. Go to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} [pricing page](https://console.{DomainName}/pricing/). 
2. Use one of the **Estimate Your Costs** widgets, or click **Open Calculator** to use the **Down to the penny pricing calculator**.

To use the calculator, type your projected monthly usage of the listed resources; for example, number of instances or push notifications. Click inside the **Monthly Usage** field for hints about the units that are expected in the field. The calculator displays the price for your input immediately. You can also adjust the calculator to display yearly costs instead of monthly costs.

###Calculating your costs manually
{: #manual}

You might want to estimate your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} costs yourself, or better understand how {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} costs are calculated. You can calculate the total price of using {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} to build and host your app by considering the prices of the runtime and the services it uses. The prices of runtimes and services sometimes change, so you must refer to the latest information on the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} pricing sheet when you calculate the total price.

###Example: Pricing a sample app
{: #sample}

Assume that you have a Node.js web application with scalability capabilities, and that the application uses several services that are provided by {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}. You can learn how the actual cost of your application is calculated in this example. The web application uses the following {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} services and items:

* Four 256 MB Node.js runtime instances
* Two {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} policies, processor and memory
* 2 GB per month {{site.data.keyword.datacshort}}
* 150 GB per month NoSQL database, 100,000 heavy API calls, and 500,000 light API calls
* 8 GB per month {{site.data.keyword.sqldb}} Database
* 20 GB inbound or outbound network traffic

###Prices for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} resources
{: #sample_resources}

To keep the example simple, assume that the prices in the following table do not fluctuate within or between a time frame, for example, a month. All pricing in this example is in US currency.

|Service |	Features |	Price |
|--------|-----------|--------|
|SDK for Node.js |	375 GB-hours free per month (shared across all runtimes) |	0.07 CNY/GB-hour|
|Auto-Scaling |	Free service plan for the Auto-Scaling service |	Free|
|Data Cache - Starter |	1 GB of cache space and a replica |	55.00 CNY/instance |
|Data Cache - Standard |	5 GB of cache space and a replica |	155.00 CNY/instance |
|Data Cache - Premium |	25 GB of cache space and a replica |	505.00 CNY/instance|
|IBM CloudantÂ® NoSQL DB for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} |	2 GB of free data storage<br/>50,000 light API calls free per month<br/>10,000 heavy API calls free per month | 1.00 CNY/GB<br/>0.03 CNY/1000 light API calls<br/>0.15 CNY/1000 heavy API calls |
|SQL Database 	| 2 GB free per instance<br/>10 GB maximum per instance |	30.00 CNY/instance |
*Table 7. Pricing sheet*

###Calculating the application price

The price of the application can be calculated in the following way:

<dl>
<dt>Four 256 MB Node.js runtime instances</dt>
<dd>{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} charges for a runtime by GB-hours. The number of GB used per month is <code>4 x 256 = 1024 MB or 1 GB per month</code>. Assume that there are <code>24 x 30 = 720 hours in a month</code>, so the application is charged for <code>1 x 720 = 720 GB-hours</code>.
<p>
375 GB-hours are included in a free allowance per month, shared across all {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} runtimes. So the total cost for the runtime is <code>0.07 x (720-375) = 24.15</code>.</p></dd>

<dt>Two Auto-Scaling policies (processor and memory)</dt>
<dd>The Auto-Scaling policies are free of charge.</dd>

<dt>2 GB per month Data Cache</dt>
<dd>The 50 MB plan that is provided by the Data Cache service is free of charge. However, the free plan would not cover your projected use of 2 GB per month. The three paid plans for Data Cache cost a set amount for a specific amount of space, regardless of how much space you actually use. Therefore, you want to choose the minimum plan that meets your projected use, which is the standard plan of 5 GB. The total cost is 155 CNY per month.</dd>

<dt>150 GB per month NoSQL database</dt>
<dd>The IBM Cloudant NoSQL DB for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} service charges are based on data storage and the ability to access that data by different API methods. The <strong>PUT</strong> and <strong>POST</strong> commands are considered as heavy API calls, but <strong>GET</strong> commands are considered as light API calls.
<p>
Add up the number of GB and deduct a 2 GB free allowance. 148 GB is charged per month. Subtract the free allowance of 50,000 for light api calls and 10,000 for heavy api calls. The total storage price includes the following parts:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
<codeblock>
    148 x 1 = 148
    (450,000 / 1000) x 0.03 = 13.5
    (90,000 / 1000) x 0.15 = 13.5
</codeblock>
</pre>
<p>
The total price is 148 + 13.5 + 13.5 = 175 CNY.</p></dd>

<dt>8 GB per month SQL Database</dt>
<dd>The total price is 30 CNY per instance.</dd>

<dt>20 GB inbound or outbound network traffic</dt>
<dd>Inbound and outbound network traffic is free of charge.</dd>

</dl>

When all the items are added, the total price of the application is 384.15 CNY.

###Supported currencies

##Usage dashboard
{: #usage}

As an account owner or a billing manager, you can use the Usage Dashboard page to see the real-time charges for the runtimes and services that are used per month in your organizations. You can see the runtime GB-hours and service consumption in all regions, or you can select to see a particular region and space, for the past 12 months.

To open the **Usage Dashboard** page, click **Account** &gt; *your_account_name* &gt; **Usage Dashboard**. In the page, you can see a summary of the runtime and service usage for the account. Billing managers can see the details for only the organizations in which they are billing managers.

The account owner is charged for the total usage that is incurred across all organizations at the end of each billing cycle. Each billing cycle lasts one month.

Account owners can filter the usage summary by region and organization. The charges shown represent the amount that you, as the account owner, are billed for that month.

If you select a specific organization for the **Organization**, you can see the total usage for that organization, including any usage as part of a free tier. The charges shown for the organization are not the charges that you are billed. The free tier usage is shown as free at the account level, but not at the organizational level. Therefore, when you view the organizational usage, you see the real usage for that organization including both free and charged usage. All organizational usage is rolled up to the account usage after the free tier is removed.

##Viewing credits
{: #credits}

As an account owner or a billing manager, you can use the **Usage Dashboard** page to see any credits for your account. You might have credits if, for example, you linked a SoftLayer account with a {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account.

To open the **Usage Dashboard** page, click **Account**. On the page that is displayed, click **Usage Dashboard**. In the page, you can see any credits, if they exist, and when they expire.

##Notifications
{: #notifications}

As an account manager, you can set spending notifications against the total cost of your account, for your runtime, services, and for individual services, excluding third-party services. You receive notifications when you reach 80%, 90%, and 100% of the spending thresholds that you specify.

To open the **Notifications** view, click **Account** &gt; *your_account_name* &gt; **Spending Notifications**. Enter a numeric value to set the spending threshold for triggering a notification for each type of spending notification as needed. You can also add and delete notifications for individual services.

##How to change your plan
{: #changing}

You can change your service plan in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} in the service Dashboard, if plan changes are enabled for that service.

Only certain services provide the ability for you to change the service plan. If plan changes are enabled for the service, the service Dashboard displays a **Plan** option in the navigation. Each service has a different set of next steps to follow if you change your plan.

1. To change your plan, in the service Dashboard, click **Plan**. Typically, you can upgrade your plan or reduce your plan.
2. After you change your plan, you must complete a set of next steps. The steps vary depending on the type of plan change and the service. For example, if you reduced your plan, you might need to restage your app. Or, if you upgraded your plan, you might need to restage your app and take other actions.<br/><br/>To restage your app, go to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dashboard and find the app that the service is bound to. In the app menu, select **Restart App**.<br/><br/>Other next step actions depend on the service. See the following table for specific actions.

|Service |	Information|
|--------|-------------|
