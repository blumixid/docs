### Infrastructure
{: #bluemixoverviewinfrastructure}

The Infrastructure dashboard provides various services to fit your cloud infrastructure needs.

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} infrastructure provides the highest performing cloud infrastructure available. {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} infrastructure is one platform, which takes data centers around the world that are full of the widest range of cloud computing options, then integrates and automates everything. Cloud data centers are filled with first class computing, storage, and networking gear. Each location is built, outfitted, and operated in the same way, so you get exactly the same capabilities and availability anywhere in our footprint. Locations are connected by the industryâ€™s most advanced network-in-a-network, which integrates distinct public, private, and internal management networks to deliver lower total networking costs, better access, and higher speed. Also, the data centers and network share a single proprietary management system. One management tool lets you control everything--every bare metal server, virtual server, and storage device--all accessible by API, portal, and mobile applications.

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} infrastructure offers powerful bare metal servers and flexible virtual servers in a single seamless platform. All are provided on demand and billed on monthly or hourly terms. Bare metal servers provide the raw horsepower for your processor-intensive and disk I/O-intensive workloads and can be configured to your exact specifications. Virtual servers allow for high speed of deployment, flexible scalability, and pay-as-you-go billing. For high performance computing, give your cloud a boost with graphics processing unit (GPU) servers, available by the hour or monthly. 

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} infrastructure offerings are connected to a three-tiered network, segmenting public, private, and management traffic. Infrastructure on a customer's {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account might transfer data between one another across the private network at no cost. Infrastructure offerings, such as bare metal servers, virtual servers, and cloud storage, connect to other applications and services in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog, such as Watson services, containers, or runtimes, across the public network. Data transfer between those two types of offerings is metered and charged at standard public network bandwidth rates.

## Using the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console
{: #bluemixoverviewui}

When you access the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console, the menu bar displays links or buttons to sign up, log in, access documentation, and access the catalog. After you log in, the menu bar contains a hamburger menu ![Hamburger icon](/docs/icons/icon_hamburger.svg) and additional links, depending on your account type:

* If you are a new {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} user, you can use the hamburger menu ![Hamburger icon](/docs/icons/icon_hamburger.svg) to switch between the Apps, Services, or Infrastructure dashboards. Links to support and account options are displayed, and you can use the **Catalog** link to access {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, compute, and infrastructure services. 

* If you are an existing user with a {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account, you can use the hamburger menu ![Hamburger icon](/docs/icons/icon_hamburger.svg) to switch between the Apps and Services dashboards. Links to support and account options are displayed, and you can use the **Catalog** link to access {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} and  compute services. 


## {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} public architecture
{: #architecture}

In general, you don't have to worry about the operating system and infrastructure layers when running apps on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} in Cloud Foundry. Layers such as root filesystems and middleware components are abstracted so that you can focus on your application code. However, you can learn more about these layers if you need specifics on where your app is running. 

See [Viewing {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} infrastructure layers](/docs/manageapps/infra.html#viewinfra) for details.

As a developer, you can interact with the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} infrastructure by using a browser-based user interface. You can also use a Cloud Foundry command line interface, called cf, to deploy web apps.

Clients--which can be mobile apps, apps that run externally, apps that are built on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, or developers that are using browsers--interact with the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}-hosted apps. Clients use REST or HTTP APIs to route requests through {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} to one of the app instances or the composite services.

The following figure shows the high-level {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} architecture.

![{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} architecture](images/arch.png)

## How {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} works
{: #howwork}

When you deploy an app to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, you must configure {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} with enough information to support the app.

* For a mobile app, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} contains an artifact that represents the mobile app's back end, such as the services that the mobile app uses to communicate with a server.
* For a web app, you must ensure that information about the runtime and framework is communicated to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, so that {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} can set up the appropriate execution environment to run the app.

Each execution environment, including both mobile and web, is isolated from the execution environment of other apps. The execution environments are isolated even though these apps are on the same physical machine. The following figure shows the basic flow of how {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} manages the deployment of apps:

![Deploying an app](images/deploy.png)

Figure 2. Deploying an app

When you create an app and deploy it to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} environment determines an appropriate virtual server to send the app, or the artifacts that the app represents, to. For a mobile app, a mobile back-end projection is created on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}. Any code for the mobile app running in the cloud eventually runs in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} environment. For a web app, the code running in the cloud is the app itself that the developer deploys to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}. The determination of the virtual server is based on several factors, including:

* The load already on the machine
* Runtimes or frameworks supported by that virtual server.

After a virtual server is chosen, an application manager on each virtual server installs the appropriate framework and runtime for the app. Then, the app can be deployed into that framework. When the deployment completes, the application artifacts are started.

The following figure shows the structure of a virtual server, also known as Droplet execution agent (DEA), that has multiple apps deployed to it:

![Design of a virtual server](images/container.png)

Figure 3. Design of a virtual server

In each virtual server, an application manager communicates with the rest of the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} infrastructure, and manages the apps that are deployed to this virtual server. Each virtual server has containers to separate and protect apps. In each container, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} installs the appropriate framework and runtime that are required for each app.

When the app is deployed, if it has a web interface (as for a Java web app), or other REST-based services (such as mobile services exposed publicly to the mobile app), users of the app can communicate with it by using normal HTTP requests.

![Invoking a {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} app](images/execute.png)

Figure 4. Invoking a {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} app

Each app can have one or more URLs associated with it, but they must all point to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} endpoint. When a request comes in, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} examines the request, determines which app it is intended for, then selects an instance of the app to receive the request.



















   








### {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} resilience
{: #resiliency}

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} is designed to host scalable resilient apps and application artifacts that can scale to meet your needs, remain highly available, and be quick to recover from problems. {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} separates components that track the state of interactions (stateful) from components that do not (stateless). This separation allows {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} to move apps flexibly as needed to achieve scalability and resilience.

You can have one or more instances running for your app. For multiple instances of a single app, the app is uploaded only once. However, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} deploys the number of instances of the app requested, and distributes them across as many virtual servers as possible.

You must save all persistent data in a stateful data store that is outside of your app, such as on one of the data store services that {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} provides. Because anything cached in memory or on disk might not be available even after a restart, you can use the memory space or file system of a single {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} instance as a brief single-transaction cache. With a single instance setup, the request to your app might be interrupted because of the stateless nature of {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}. A best practice is to use at least three instances for each app to ensure the availability of your app.

All {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} infrastructure, Cloud Foundry components, and {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}-specific management components are highly available. Multiple instances of the infrastructure are used to balance the load.

### Integration with systems of record
{: #sor}

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} can help developers by connecting two broad categories of systems in a cloud environment: 

* *Systems of record* include apps and databases that store business records and automate standardized processes. 
* *Systems of engagement* are capabilities that expand the usefulness of systems of record and make them more engaging to users.

By integrating a system of record with the app that you create in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, you can perform the following actions:

 * Enable secure communication between the app and the back-end database by downloading and installing a secure connector on premise.
 * Invoke a database in a secure way.
 * Create APIs from integration flows with databases and back-end systems, such as customer relationship management system.
 * Expose only the schemas and tables that you want to be exposed to the app.
 * As a {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} organization manager, publish an API as a private service that is visible only to your organization members.
 




    

    


#### Scenario: Creating a rich mobile app to connect with your system of record
{: #scenario}

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} provides a platform where you can integrate your mobile app, cloud services, and enterprise systems of record to provide an app that interacts with your on-premises data.

For example, you can build a mobile app to interact with your customer relationship management system that resides on-premises behind a firewall. You can invoke the system of record in a secure way and leverage the mobile services in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} so that you can build a rich mobile app.

First, your integration developer creates the mobile back-end app in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}. They use the Mobile Cloud boilerplate that uses the Node.js runtime that they are most familiar with.

Then, by using the Cloud Integration service in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} user interface, they expose an API through a secure connector. Your integration developer downloads the secure connector and installs it on-premises to enable secure communication between his API and the database. After they create the database endpoint, they can look at all the schemas and extract the tables that they want to expose as APIs to the app.

The integration developer adds the Push service to deliver mobile notifications to interested consumers. They also add a business partner service to tweet when a new customer record is created with a Twitter API.

Next, as the application developer, you can log in to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, download the Android development toolkit, and develop code that invokes the APIs that your integration developer created. You can develop a mobile app that enables users to enter their information on their mobile device. The mobile app then creates a customer record in the customer management system. When the record is created, the app pushes a notification to a mobile device and initiates a tweet about the new record.
