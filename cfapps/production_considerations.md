# Running apps in production
{: #production}

Cloud Foundry is an excellent platform for running cloud-ready applications in production. These best practices can help with running production Cloud Foundry apps with Bluemix.
{:shortdesc}

## Multiple instances
{: #multiple_instances}

Cloud-ready apps are horizontally scalable, and are therefore able to dynamically add or remove application instances. Run at least three instances of each application to help avoid unexpected downtime in the event of isolated incidents or platform maintenance.


## Monitoring options
{: #monitoring}

Check out [Monitoring and logging Cloud Foundry apps](../monitor_log/monitoringandlogging.html#monitoring_logging_bluemix_apps) for more information.

## Support options
{: #support}

Bluemix paid pricing plan offers a number of different account types with *optional* paid support.  No matter the type of your account, if you plan to bring an application to production on Bluemix, consider enrolling in this option.

With or without paid support, you can get help as described at [Getting customer support](../support/index.html), but paying for support will help  ensure that your support tickets will be given the level attention that they deserve.
